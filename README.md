## Stage 2: Assignment and Communication
Now we will assign the ticket to a help desk agent. Sign in to osTicket as an agent. I used the ken.jay credentials. Select the ticket we just created.

Agent Ken would see that this is a a Sev-A emergency ticket as mobile online banking being down can lead in a loss in profits for the organization. Therefore, they reassign the ticket to the System Administrators Department. As an effective and thorough agent, Ken leaves a message documenting and explaining the situation.

## Stage 3: Working the Issue
Agent Mary on the back-end works on the issue and communicates with both agent Ken and the customer. She also makes sure to switch the status of the ticket from "open" to "resolved".

## Stage 4: Resolution
Support Agent Ken should be able to see in his portal that Sys Admin Mary has left a message that the ticket is now closed. Awesome! You've successfuly created a resolved a support ticket. This was a very simple scenario that walked you through the lifecycle of a support ticket.
